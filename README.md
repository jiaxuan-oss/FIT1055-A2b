Assignment Instructions
This is the second part of your group assignment, a continuation of group Assignment 2a.
In this assignment, your group must implement the proposed solution as a prototype and present it to the classroom during your tutorial session (Week 11). 
To complete this assignment, you must:
Based on your proposed solution from Assignment 2a, conduct your first group meeting. In this meeting 
Plan together how to conduct and implement your prototype
Decide on which prototyping method to use
Apply the prototype technique learned during the workshop to create a representation of your proposed solution (Week 11 tutorial).
Use the minto pyramid principle (Week 3 tutorial) to prepare presentation slides and organize in your team who will be presenting what. The presentation slide should include the following (rule of thumb since presentation time is 20 minutes, the maximum number of slides should be 15):
Introduction 
Outline of presentation content
Background
Problem statement 
Prototype methodology (i.e., prototype techniques) 
Proposed Solution 
Summary Prototype Demonstration


Ensure you refer to the marking rubric on what to include in each slide section.
Each team member should prepare a script for his/her oral presentation and follow effective oral presentation skills (Week 3 tutorial).  Each team member should focus on a key contribution that they have made to the prototype design during the presentation.
Ensure each team member is delegated the same amount of time in presenting.
You should annotate the features of your prototype and indicate what function each element of the prototype is intended to support in the PowerPoint slides.
